## Task 1
Create a simple calculator that proceses the given string of operators "(", ")", "+", "-", "*", "/" and numbers separated by spaces and returns the value of that expression.

Example:
```
Calculator().evaluate("2 / 2 + 3 * 4 - 6") => 7
```
Remember about the order of operations! Multiplications and divisions have a higher priority and should be performed left-to-right. Additions and subtractions have a lower priority and should also be performed left-to-right.

## Task 2

Create a set of unit tests to check the calculator implemented in task 1.

Note: you can use any library for tests creation.

## Task 3

Make a visualization for tasks 1:
  1) input field - entering a value for the “calculator”;
  2) output field - result;


and task 2:
  1) output field - the result of unit tests;
  2) button - run tests.


 Note: styles are up to you.
